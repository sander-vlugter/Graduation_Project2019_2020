# Graduation project 2019-2020 code
Code created/used during my internship
# Validation of MutationalPatterns:
Using PCAWG data. The PanCancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) project datasets are available for use by researchers under the standard ICGC publication policy terms which allows for unrestricted use provided that the data is not used to identify donors.

# Mutational signature profiling of metastatic cancers: 
Using HMF data, the whole genome sequencing HMF data and corresponding clinical data have been obtained from the Hartwig Medical Foundation. Both whole genome sequencing and the clinical data is freely available for academic use from the Hartwig Medical Foundation through standardized procedures, request forms can be found at https://www.hartwigmedicalfoundation.nl/
# Additional information:
The code has been split into either technical analysis (validation of mutationalpatterns) and biological analysis (mutational signatures profiling of metastatic cancers).
